Libgdx examples in Scala
=====

This repository is serving as both a learning tool for myself, and (eventually) as 
a reference for implementing a bunch of the libgdx examples in scala.

Generally the scala in this project is not idomatic, and instead looks more like java. 
This is on purpose -- garbage generation is the enemy of smooth gaming.
